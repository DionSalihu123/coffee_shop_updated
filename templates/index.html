					<p class = "cards-description">A macchiato is a classic Italian coffee drink that is known for its bold flavor and simplicity.
					The term "macchiato" means "stained" or "spotted" in Italian,
					which refers to the process of marking the espresso with a small amount of steamed milk.</p>

					<p class = "cards-description">Espresso is known for its strong and bold flavor. A typical shot of espresso is
					about 1 ounce (30 ml) and contains a higher concentration of coffee oils, sugars, and dissolved solids than regular brewed coffee.</p>

					<p class = "cards-description">A latte is a popular coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk. It's known for its smooth
					and creamy texture, often topped with a small layer of foam. The ratio of milk to espresso gives it a mild, rich flavor, making it less
					intense than a straight espresso but more robust than a cappuccino.</p>

				About Us - The Coffee Journey

				At Coffee Shop , we believe coffee is more than just a drink; it’s an experience, a ritual, and a connection. Our journey began with a simple idea: 
				to serve the perfect cup, sourced with care and brewed to perfection. We work closely with farmers who share our commitment to sustainability, ensuring
				that every bean we roast has a story — one that starts in the fertile soils of the world's best coffee-growing regions.</p>
